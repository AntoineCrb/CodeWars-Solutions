## Description

This project references all the kata I have solved, classified in different files from the simplest to the most complex  (8kyu -> 1 kyu).
I did not put the problems rated under 6 kyu because they are too simple and do not need to be here.

## What is CodeWars ?

CodeWars is a website with problems called Katas made by the community to train and improve their skills, more information [here](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/About-Codewars "here").
